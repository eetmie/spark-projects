    the check that matters — the graphs travel as `.onnx` + `.onnx.data` pairs, and a
    truncated external-data file fails minutes later at engine-build time with an
    error that names neither the file nor the cause.

    `exclude_meta` drops `_meta_*.json`, the exporter's per-graph-family scratch used
    only to rebuild `bundle.json` on a partial re-export. `ship_bundle.sh` excludes
    them from the transfer, so a manifest that listed them would fail verification on
    the target for files that were never meant to travel. A manifest must describe
    the bundle AS SHIPPED. Pass False only for a bundle you are hashing in place.
