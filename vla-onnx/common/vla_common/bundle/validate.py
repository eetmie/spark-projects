    """Raise if `path` has a node with an empty REQUIRED input, then run the checker.

    The TorchScript exporter can silently emit nodes whose required inputs are empty
    strings; the file writes fine and only fails minutes later when ORT tries to load
    it ("input 0 is marked single but has an empty string"). Checking here keeps that
    failure next to the code that caused it.

    An empty string is only a defect in a REQUIRED position. ONNX also uses "" as the
    legal way to omit a trailing optional input, which is exactly what the tracer
    emits for the DaViT window-attention `Pad` (`constant_value` omitted, because the
    pads are all zero at 224x224 — every feature map divides by the window size).
    Flagging those rejected a graph that `onnx.checker` passes and that ORT loads
    happily, so the op schema decides which positions matter rather than a blanket
    rule. When the schema is unknown the blanket rule is restored, so an unrecognised
    op fails closed rather than slipping through.
